Domain driven development is the primary part of my job.  
I love it because it minimizes overall cost of an application's maintenance and simplifies future development.  
TDD helps me to skyrocket the quality of a project by writing less code that does exactly what it intends to.  
I am not afraid to claim that building RESTful APIs and flexible applications is an easy task for me.  
Years of experience have proven that one person can barely handle everything especially when a
project grows huge. My primary goal is spreading good practices and sharing experience with every
passionate developer to make development fast, qualitative and most importantly easy.  
I am looking for the new experience with people who have other mentality and knowledge to master our skills.
